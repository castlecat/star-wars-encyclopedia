This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After all dependencies have been installed, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Lastly, open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the project in your development environment.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
